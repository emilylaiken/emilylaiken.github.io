                   <div class="about-text">
                       <p>We tested each model on three different data sets: a set of basic census predictors (population of MSA, ages distribution of MSA, gender distribution of MSA, and median income of MSA), a set of all census predictors, and a set of all census predictors plus rates of other crimes. 
                        In each case, we found that rates of other crimes were (as one would expect) much more powerful predictors of murder rate than predictors 
                        from the census data. Our base model was a linear regression on only the basic census data predictors, which had a test-set R2 of close to 0, 
                        meaning it has no more predictive power than predicting the average murder rate for each MSA. The same simple linear regression performed slightly
                        better when using all census predictors and significantly better when using all census predictors plus other crime data. A similar pattern was 
                        observed in the other linear regression-style models we tried, including forward selection of predictors from the simple linear regression, a 
                        linear regression on PCA components, LASSO regression, and Ridge regression. We also tried three quite different styles of models: k-NN 
                        regression, a regression tree, and a random forrest of regression trees. Ultimately, our most predictive model was XX, which scored a test R2 of 
                        XX using only basic census predictors, XX using all census predictors, and XX using all census predictors plus other crime data.</p>

                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>We ran a LASSO regression using cross-validation to determine the optimal penalty parameter. </p>

                    <h5>Results</h5> 
                    <p>Overall, LASSO regression was the best of all the models we tested, scoring test-set R<sup>2</sup>'s of .006 (basic census data), .01 (all census data), and .5 (all census and crime data), respectively--see the figure at left for more detail.</p>
                    <h5>Observations</h5>
                       <p>LASSO regression shrunk the coefficients of many predictors in each dataset to 0, which was useful for understanding which predictors are significant. In the basic dataset, the significant predictors included age, total population of the MSA, income, and year. The additional non-zero predictors in the dataset of all census predictors were enrollment of young adults in college or graduate school, enrollment of primary school-aged children, poverty status, and the educational attainment level of adults in the population. In the final dataset, which included rates of crimes other than murder, the significant crime-related predictors were rates of robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, violent crime, property crime, and rape (that is, the rates of each crime except for larceny-theft).</p>

                   <div class="about-text">
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>We ran a Ridge regression using cross-validation to determine the optimal penalty parameter. </p>

                    <h5>Results</h5> 
                    <p>Ridge regression did not perform quite as well as LASSO, scoring test-set R<sup>2</sup>'s of .002 (basic census data), -.15 (all census data), and .46 (all census and crime data).
                    <h5>Observations</h5>
                       <p>It seems that one of the reason Ridge may not score as well as LASSO on the test sets is that is overfits the data more, as suggested by the larger gaps between scores on training and test sets (as compared with LASSO). This tendency to overfit is also consistent with the fact that Ridge does not shrink coefficients to 0 while LASSO does--our dataset has many predictors, and therefore regressions that use all of them are more likely to overfit. The negative R<sup>2</sup> value on the test set for the dataset with all census predictors is also consistent with overfitting (as seen in earlier models such as XX).</p>

                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>We built a single regression tree, using cross validation to determine the optimal depth of the tree. The results of the cross-validation procedure for one dataset (all census predictors) are depicted in the figure at left. The optimal tree depth was determined to be 3 on each of the datasets. We didn’t use probabilistic feature dropout nor cross validation to choose the maximum number of features. We opted to keep this model simple given that random forest incorporates these ensemble complexities in a more useful way.</p>

                    <h5>Results</h5> 
                    <p>The single regression tree performed quite poorly compared to the linear regression-based models: the test-set $R<sup>2</sup> value for both the census predictor datasets (the basic set and the full set) were below 0. For the dataset with all predictors (census and crime), the single regression tree had a test-set $R<sup>2</sup> of .44.

                   <div class="about-text">
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>Building on the single regression tree we had already built, we built a random forest of regression trees, using cross validation to determine the optimal ensemble size one each of thre three datasets. This cross validation process (for the dataset with all predictors, both crime and census), is depicted in the figure at left.</p>

                    <h5>Results</h5> 
                    <p>Like the single regression tree, the random forest performed quite poorly on all datasets except the one including data for crimes besides murder. Again, both the test-set $R<sup>2</sup> for both the basic and full set of census predictors was below 0 (though not quite as far below as for the single tree). When all predictors, including crime levels, were used, the test set $R<sup>2</sup> was still only .27. 
                    <h5>Observations</h5>
                       <p>Although the random forest performed poorly, it did give us some insight into which predictors are the most important. XXX</p>

                   <br />
                   <div class="about-text">
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>We ran a k-NN regression using all predictors available in each dataset, using cross-validation to determine the optimal number of neighbors. For the dataset containing only basic census predictors, this meant 80 neighbors, for the one containing all census predictors, it was 89, and for the one containing all census predictors and crimes besides murder, it was only 9.</p>

                    <h5>Results</h5> 
                    <p>The k-NN regression performed the best of all models on the basic census predictors, reaching a test-set R<sup>2</sup> of 0.015. It also performed very well on the dataset with all census predictors, with a test-set R<sup>2</sup> of .012 (though the fact that the test-set R<sup>2</sup> was lower when using more predictors suggests overfitting). Relative to other models, the k-NN regression didn't do as well on the full dataset including both census predictors and crimes other than murder, with a test-set R<sup>2</sup> of only .31. The figure at left depicts the scores of each k-NN model on the respective training and test sets.
